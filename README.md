# Cycling-Performance
I was gifted a Peloton stationary bike in 2024 to complement a hybrid bike I use when the weather is much nicer.

I do not subscribe to Peloton; rather, I use the 'Just Ride' feature to create a customized cycling program. 

There is a readout at the end of each ride. I have been recording the metrics from each readout.

Those metrics are the basis of this data project.
