# Cycling-Performance
I was gifted a Peloton stationary bike in 2024 to complement a hybrid bike I use when the weather is much nicer.

I do not subscribe to Peloton; rather, I use the 'Just Ride' feature to create a customized cycling program. 

There is a readout at the end of each ride. I have been recording the metrics from each readout.

Those metrics are the basis of this data project.

Power BI is a great tool. DAX is a wonderful language, but it is challenging. I have started focusing less on how DAX works (a filter context filters and a row context iterates) and more about what expressions, functions etc. do (i.e., the purpose of a Variable). This is simply my way of moving closer to becoming more fluent in the language.
